Welcome to my Command Line RPG!

In this game you explore your computer using the command line interface. You get to chose which type of mythical creature you become and battle your way through monsters to ultimately find treasure!

This game currently does not have a GUI and is very user friendly. Enjoy the narrative and follow simple on screen prompts to play.

You can open through CMD.

This simple RPG features a a main class which calls upon a lot of different methods to ultimately complete the game.
This includes different types of loops and data storage and manipulation using arrays and global variables.

Global variables are really important in game-esque interfaces because it allows different methods to call and alter them!

Code has also been optimized from its original version to delete repetitive chunks. This can be tracked through GitHub updates.

I ultimately would like to give this game a simple GUI. Currently it does not feature as much input validation as I would like.

I would also like to offer players the opportunity to store their score using firebase database. 

Currently the characters have a lot more 'stats' than are implimented. I think it would be good to add things like 'luck' and 'dexterity' to the method in charge of enemy battles. 

Current code does not have the right storage containers for large clumps of data! :(

Thanks for reading!
